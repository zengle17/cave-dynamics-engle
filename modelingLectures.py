Modeling...
taking a differential equation and making a computer work with it through
matrix algebra
test relationships
predict future or past
solve diff eqs w/o analytical solns
link data and model and uncertainties
you make an assumption that your data is a linear fit or sin fit (sin(time/period))
    or log or squareroot, etc.j
    Whats the right functional form?
    Whats the right parameters to assign?
        both are uncertainties
        
How to model...
Full realism or simplified rules... use a set of continuum equations
agent based: agents making decisions... decisions to put in model based on observation

vectors (row and column vectors) are 1D Matrices
2D matricies (M x N) rows first column second notation
    diagonal can act as a scalar
    identity matrix is diagonal full of ones
